Types of integrations we can have with influencers
Mentions – a “shoutout” style partnership, where you talk about the brand for anywhere from 30-60 seconds.
Integrations – a longer “shoutout” style partnership where you talk about the brand for anywhere from 90 seconds to 2 minutes. The integration should be relevant to the video and talking about the brand should feel more natural to the viewer.  
Dedicated Videos –  an entire video about the brand or the product that they’re sent to you. 
Shorts – a brand sponsors a Short instead of a full video.





Factors Influencing Creator Pricing
Subscriber Count & Engagement: Larger channels with more engaged audiences can command higher prices. 
Niche and Audience Value: Niches like technology and finance may have higher CPMs due to high-value audiences. 
Video Length and Placement: Longer integrations or integrations in prominent spots may cost more. 
Content Type: Creators can charge a flat fee for the video or use pricing models like Cost Per Mille (CPM) or Cost Per View (CPV). 
Negotiation: Brands and creators negotiate the terms, and the first price quoted by the creator can serve as a starting point for negotiation. 
How to Determine Your Collaboration Rate
Calculate Your Average Views and CPM: Use your YouTube Analytics to find out how many average views your videos receive. 
Decide on a Pricing Model:
Flat Fee: A set price for the sponsored content. 
CPM (Cost Per Mille): A payment for every thousand views the sponsored video receives. 
CPV (Cost Per View): A set amount for each view of the sponsored advertisement. 
Consider Your Value: Be professional and provide clear justifications for your pricing based on your audience's value and the effort involved
